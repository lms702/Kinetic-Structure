# Kinetic-Structure
Arduino code for the Kinetic Structure project for the USC 3D Printing club 3D4E. The consists of several spinning layers that move when the Arduino recieves a signal from a bluetooth receiver. Because the receiver and speaker are not always connected to the structure, there from an open analog input. The program still filters the signal somewhat so that it only activates the motor when a constant signal is present(it will not turn on for a random singular surge to the input). The motors are only turned on when music is playing and the button is switched on.
